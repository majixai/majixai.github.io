# DBS Directory

This directory is intended for the storage of database files and other data assets.

## Monitoring for .dat Files

The `index.html` page in this directory can be used to monitor for the presence of `.dat` files. It reads a list of files from the `files.json` manifest and displays any that have the `.dat` suffix.

To use it, open `index.html` in a web browser. A local web server is recommended to avoid potential CORS issues when fetching the manifest file.
