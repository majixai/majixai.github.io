It is also a 'coherent' risk measure (satisfies certain mathematical properties like subadditivity, meaning diversifying always reduces CVaR).</p><h3>Takeaway:</h3><p>CVaR (Expected Shortfall) is a superior risk measure to VaR as it quantifies the expected loss *in the worst cases*, providing a more complete picture of tail risk.</p>"
