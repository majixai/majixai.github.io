        "content": "<h3>Concept: Momentum Oscillator Measuring Speed & Change</h3><p>RSI measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions. It assesses internal strength based on gains vs. losses.</p><h3>Calculation (Conceptual):</h3><p>Compares the average gain on 'up' days to the average loss on 'down' days over a specified period (typically 14). Formula involves calculating Relative Strength (RS = Avg Gain / Avg Loss) and scaling it to oscillate between 0 and 100. <br><code>RSI = 100 - [100 / (1 + RS)]</code></p><h3>Interpretation (Connecting to Calculus):</h3><ul><li><strong>Measures internal momentum/velocity:</strong> High RSI means average upward price changes > average downward changes recently. Relates to the net positive rate of change.</li><li><strong>> 70:</strong> Generally considered 'Overbought'.</li><li><strong>< 30:</strong> Generally considered 'Oversold'.</li><li><strong>Divergence:</strong> Price makes new high/low, but RSI doesn't - signals weakening momentum (rate of change isn't confirming price extremes).</li></ul><h3>Takeaway:</h3><p>RSI quantifies the speed and magnitude of recent price movements (internal momentum) to identify potential overbought/oversold levels.</p>"

Current High - Current Low<br> 2. |Current High - Previous Close| (Accounts for upward gaps)<br> 3. |Current Low - Previous Close| (Accounts for downward gaps)</p><h3>Calculating ATR:</h3><p>Typically a 14-period Exponential Moving Average (or SMA) of the True Range values.</p><h3>Interpretation:</h3><ul><li><strong>High ATR:</strong> Indicates higher recent volatility (larger price swings/ranges).</li><li><strong>Low ATR:</strong> Indicates lower recent volatility (smaller price swings/ranges).</li><li>Often used for setting stop-loss levels or position sizing (adjusting size based on volatility).</li></ul><h3>Takeaway:</h3><p>ATR provides a measure of recent market volatility by averaging the true price range (including gaps), independent of price direction.</p>"
