        "content": "<h3>Concept: Structure Creates Meaning</h3><p>How a sentence is constructed (its syntax) significantly impacts its meaning, emphasis, and tone. Analyzing structure reveals authorial choices.</p><h3>Questions to Ask:</h3><ul><li>What is the core independent clause? What is the main statement?</li><li>What are the dependent clauses/phrases doing? (Adding reasons, conditions, descriptions?)</li><li>Is coordination or subordination used? What relationship does this show?</li><li>Is the sentence simple, compound, complex, or compound-complex? Why might this structure be used here?</li><li>Is the sentence loose or periodic? What is the effect?</li><li>Are there parallel structures? What is being balanced or listed?</li><li>Is voice active or passive? Who or what is emphasized?</li></ul><h3>Takeaway:</h3><p>Don't just read for content; analyze the sentence structure itself as a key component of how meaning is built and conveyed in academic texts.</p>"
