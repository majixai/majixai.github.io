It can be either ON (allowing electric current to flow, representing a '1') or OFF (blocking current, representing a '0').</p><h3>Function:</h3><p>Billions of these transistors, arranged in complex circuits (logic gates), perform calculations and data manipulation by controlling the flow of electricity based on input signals.</p><h3>Scaling (Moore's Law):</h3><p>Historically, the number of transistors on integrated circuits roughly doubled every two years (Moore's Law observation), leading to exponential increases in computing power and miniaturization. While physical limits are being reached, this trend drove decades of progress.</p><h3>Takeaway:</h3><p>Transistors are the fundamental switches enabling digital computation.
