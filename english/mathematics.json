        "content": "<h3>Concept: Non-Redundancy in Vectors</h3><p>A set of vectors <code>{v1, v2, ..., vk}</code> is <strong>linearly independent</strong> if the only way to form a linear combination that equals the zero vector is by using all zero scalars (coefficients).</p><h3>Defining Equation:</h3><p>The equation <code>c1*v1 + c2*v2 + ... + ck*vk = 0</code> has *only* the trivial solution <code>c1 = c2 = ... = ck = 0</code>.</p><h3>Intuition:</h3><p>None of the vectors in the set can be expressed as a linear combination of the *other* vectors in the set. Each vector adds a new, unique direction or dimension.</p><h3>Contrast (Linear Dependence):</h3><p>If there's a non-trivial solution (at least one <code>ci â‰  0</code>), the set is <strong>linearly dependent</strong>, meaning at least one vector is redundant (lies in the span of the others).</p><h3>Takeaway:</h3><p>Linear independence is crucial for defining bases and dimension of vector spaces, ensuring a minimal set of generating vectors.</p>"
