## Deeper Analysis (Timestamp: 6/2/2025, 6:21:58 PM)

**AI Data Comment:**
This deeper intraday analysis strengthens the initial bullish outlook in terms of potential for rapid, large percentage moves, primarily driven by recent news catalysts (CSE delisting, positive financials) and observed extreme volatility and high volume. However, it also highlights the significant downside risk due to the stock's volatility and potential for sharp pullbacks, as seen on June 2nd, likely amplified by algorithmic trading and sector sentiment. The analysis is based on fresh FMP data (current price $3.48, volume, day range) and recent news and technical observations up to June 3, 2025. Specific real-time intraday data for indicators, patterns, and microstructure is limited due to the market being closed at the time of analysis.

**Detailed Reasoning:**
IMCC has recently exhibited extreme price volatility, highlighted by a significant pre-market surge of over 74% on June 2nd, followed by a sharp intraday decline of nearly 13% the same day, which triggered volatility trading pauses. [3, 18, 35] The fresh FMP data shows a current price of $3.48, a significant drop from the initial assessment price of $3.423 but still within a highly volatile range with a day range of $3.2735 to $14.19 in the previous session. The enormous volume of 4,622,581 shares traded against an average volume of 113,930 underscores intense speculative interest and likely significant algorithmic trading activity amplifying price swings. [18] While specific real-time intraday technical indicator values are unavailable during market close, historical data suggests mixed signals; some sources indicate bullish momentum based on moving averages, while others show bearish or neutral stances on different timeframes. [5, 27, 32, 37] The recent news of IMCC voluntarily delisting from the CSE to consolidate on NASDAQ aims to enhance liquidity and shareholder value, which could be a positive catalyst for the next session, potentially driving increased interest and volume. [4, 6, 28] The company also reported positive Q1 2025 financial results with increased revenue, improved gross margin, and reduced operating expenses, particularly strong growth in Germany, providing a fundamental backdrop that could support upward price movements. [4, 35] The price action on June 2nd, with a rapid ascent followed by a retracement, suggests a potential blow-off top on that specific move, but the underlying increased volume and news catalysts indicate potential for continued volatility and rapid moves in the upcoming session. The rapid price changes observed indicate high positive and negative price velocity and acceleration depending on the timeframe analyzed, characteristic of a highly speculative and momentum-driven stock. Retail investor sentiment was reportedly extremely bullish following the delisting news, which could contribute to buying pressure at the next market open. [28]

### Price Projection Details
- Target: $5.00 (+43.7%)
  - Timeline: Within the first hour of next trading session (Probability: Medium)
  - Reasoning: Based on the extreme volatility and significant pre-market moves observed previously (e.g., +74% on June 2nd), a rapid move to the $5.00 level is plausible at the next open if positive momentum from the delisting news and positive financials carries over, potentially fueled by high volume and speculative interest. This level represents a significant percentage change achievable rapidly in a low-float, high-volatility stock.
  - Std Dev Levels: L1 Up: N/A, L1 Down: N/A, L2 Up: N/A, L2 Down: N/A
- Target: $2.50 (+-28.2%)
  - Timeline: Within the first hour of next trading session (Probability: Medium)
  - Reasoning: Given the stock's history of sharp pullbacks after rapid ascent and the potential for algorithmic selling or profit-taking, a quick drop towards the $2.50 support area is also a possibility at the open, especially if the initial positive momentum fades or broader market weakness emerges. This reflects the stock's high downside volatility potential.
  - Std Dev Levels: L1 Up: N/A, L1 Down: N/A, L2 Up: N/A, L2 Down: N/A

**Microstructure Insights:**
Specific real-time intraday bid-ask spread and depth of book data for IMCC were not found in the provided search results, particularly for the current after-hours period. However, the extremely high volume observed in the previous session (over 4.6 million shares vs. 113k average) strongly suggests significant trading activity. [13, 18] The mention of algorithmic trading amplifying volatility implies potential for rapid order execution and price swings due to automated strategies interacting with the order book. [18] Low liquidity outside of the immediate bid and ask could contribute to larger price movements on relatively smaller order sizes. The retail buzz and potential institutional participation indicated by high volume suggest that the microstructure at the next open could be characterized by wide spreads and rapid price discovery as orders flood in.

**Covariance Considerations:**
Based on available data, IMCC shows limited historical correlation with major indices like SPY (R-squared 0.00) and a relatively low correlation with a sector peer like TLRY (R-squared 0.20). [2] However, a recent analysis suggested IMCC's sharp drop on June 2nd was tied to broader sector pessimism in cannabis stocks rather than company-specific issues, indicating that sector-wide sentiment can still significantly influence its intraday movement despite low historical correlation coefficients. [18] In the upcoming session, a strong move in the overall market or the cannabis sector could potentially amplify or counteract IMCC's price action due to its high beta (1.913), increasing its risk profile and potential for larger percentage moves compared to the broader market. [2]

**Advanced Model References:**
While no specific advanced mathematical or financial modeling reports for IMCC's intraday dynamics were found, the discussion of algorithmic trading amplifying volatility in low-liquidity stocks like IMCC aligns with concepts in high-frequency trading models that exploit market microstructure and order flow imbalances. [18] The stock's observed rapid price changes and volatility halts are phenomena often analyzed using advanced time-series models like GARCH, which capture volatility clustering and can inform models predicting the magnitude of potential price swings in the short term.
