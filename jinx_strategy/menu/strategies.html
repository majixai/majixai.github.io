        <p><em>(If your game has different units, detail strategies for them here)</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unit A:</strong> Best used for [describe role, e.g., scouting, defense, offense]. Synergizes well with Unit B.</li>
            <li><strong>Unit B:</strong> Vulnerable to [describe weakness], but powerful against [describe strength].</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p><em>Remember, the best strategy often depends on the specific game situation and your opponent's play style. Adaptability is key!</em></p>
