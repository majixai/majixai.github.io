# AGENTS.md - Church School Lesson Plan Structure (Ages 6-7)

This directory contains a structured set of HTML templates and guidelines for developing a church school lesson plan curriculum, specifically tailored for children aged 6-7 years old. All templates are styled with W3.CSS (linked via CDN) for better visual presentation when viewed in a web browser.

## Core Philosophy: Teacher Autonomy & Adaptability

*   **You are the Curriculum Shaper:** These templates provide a framework, not a rigid script. You, the teacher, have the final say on all lesson content.
*   **Full Editability:** All HTML template files are fully editable. Modify, add, or remove content to suit your specific needs, theological emphases, and church traditions.
*   **Audience Analysis is Key:** Each school year brings a unique group of children. **It is crucial to adapt lesson plans based on an initial and ongoing analysis of your students.** This includes understanding their developmental stages (within the 6-7 range), prior knowledge, interests, learning styles, and any specific needs. This analysis will guide your choice of stories, activities, pacing, and complexity.
*   **Populate to Create Your Semester:** This structure is designed for you to populate with your detailed lesson plans, stories, activities, and resources to build out a full semester's or year's worth of material.

## How to Use This Structure:

1.  **Understand the File Format:** All templates are now `.html` files. You can open them in a web browser to view their styled layout or open them in a text editor (or HTML editor) to modify their content.
    *   Styling is provided by W3.CSS, linked from a CDN in the `<head>` of each HTML file.

2.  **Understand the Age Focus:** All materials and templates are designed with 6-7 year olds in mind. This means activities should be hands-on, engaging, and relatively short. Concepts should be concrete and relatable. Language should be simple.

3.  **Start with the Big Picture:**
    *   Review `school_year_structure_considerations.html` to think about how your overall year, terms, and special events will flow.
    *   Consult `subject_areas_overview.html` to understand the recommended subjects and their general scope for this age group. Prioritize and expand on subjects according to your specific educational goals and the time available.

4.  **Daily/Weekly Planning:**
    *   Use `daily_schedules/sample_daily_schedule_template.html` as a guide for structuring individual class days. Adapt the timing and content based on your specific class length (2-8 hours) and the topics for the day, informed by your audience analysis.

5.  **Developing Subject Content:**
    *   For each subject or thematic unit you plan, use `subject_materials/subject_unit_template.html`. This will help you detail:
        *   Learning objectives (adapted for your current students)
        *   Lesson activities (broken down, chosen for engagement)
        *   Required resources
        *   Assessment ideas
        *   Integration with other subjects
        *   Differentiation/Adaptation notes for diverse learners.

6.  **Classroom Management Resources (`classroom_management_resources/`):**
    *   `attendance_sheet_template.html`: For tracking daily/weekly attendance.
    *   `group_management_template.html`: To help organize students for group work.
    *   `emergency_contact_form_template.html`: **Crucial for student safety.**
        *   **IMPORTANT:** This form collects sensitive personal data. Ensure it is printed, completed by parents/guardians, and then **stored securely and confidentially** according to your church's privacy and child safety policies. Digital storage of completed forms within this general folder structure is **not recommended** unless the environment is specifically secured for such private data.

7.  **Assessment (`assessments/`):**
    *   Consult `grading_and_feedback_philosophy.html` for principles on age-appropriate assessment for 6-7 year olds, including notes on observing holistic development and skills relevant to "life roles." Remember, your role is to provide opportunities for growth and to observe, not to make definitive judgments about a child's entire future.
    *   `student_grades_template.html`: A styled template for manually recording observations, participation, and results from various assessments. This is for your interpretation of student work and progress.
    *   `quiz_template.html`: For simple, periodic checks of understanding.
    *   `midterm_review_ideas.html`: For engaging, holistic review sessions.
    *   `final_project_ideas_template.html`: For planning culminating projects.
    *   Assessment for this age group should be informal, observational, and encouraging.

8.  **Projects (`projects/`):**
    *   If planning larger, multi-session projects, use `project_outline_template.html` to structure the goals, steps, and materials.

9.  **Events & Awards (`events_and_awards/`):**
    *   `annual_events_calendar_template.html`: To map out special events and celebrations.
    *   `weekly_prize_system.html`: Optional guide for a fun, random prize system.

10. **Optional Reinforcement (`homework_optional/`):**
    *   `homework_classwork_ideas.html` provides suggestions for optional take-home activities or in-class extensions. Keep these genuinely optional and low-pressure.

## Expanding This Structure:

*   **Populate with Specific Content:** Your main task will be to take these HTML templates, save copies (e.g., `fall_semester_week1_schedule.html`), and fill them with your specific Bible stories, themes, activities, and resources.
    *   For example, under `subject_materials/`, you might create subfolders for each main subject (e.g., `subject_materials/bible_stories/`).
    *   Within these, you could save completed `subject_unit_template.html` files for each unit (e.g., `subject_materials/bible_stories/noahs_ark_unit.html`).
*   **Add Resource Lists:** You might create separate HTML files for lists of recommended books, songs, websites, or craft supply sources.
*   **Visuals:** Remember that for 6-7 year olds, visual aids are crucial. Note down your visual aid needs in the lesson plans. You might store digital copies of printables or links to online images in relevant folders.
*   **Consistency:** When adding new lesson plans or units, try to follow the structure provided in `subject_unit_template.html` for consistency.

## Key Considerations for 6-7 Year Olds (Reiteration):

*   **Active Learning:** Incorporate movement, songs, games, and hands-on activities.
*   **Storytelling:** Bible stories are central. Use engaging storytelling techniques.
*   **Repetition:** Young children benefit from repetition of key concepts and verses.
*   **Positive Reinforcement:** Encourage participation and effort.
*   **Flexibility:** Be prepared to adapt lessons based on children's responses and needs â€“ this is where your audience analysis comes into play daily!
*   **Faith Integration:** Continuously connect lessons back to God's love and Christian values.

This framework is intended to be a helpful and flexible starting point. May God bless your ministry to the children!
