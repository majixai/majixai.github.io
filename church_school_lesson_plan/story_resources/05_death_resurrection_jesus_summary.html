            <p>Jesus, who was perfect and never did anything wrong, came to Earth to do something incredibly important. Some leaders at the time didn't like Jesus's teachings or that people were following Him. They arrested Him, and even though He was innocent, He was sentenced to die on a cross. This was a very sad day. Jesus died and was buried in a tomb, like a cave, and a big stone was rolled in front of the entrance.</p>
            <p>Jesus's friends and disciples were very, very sad. They thought everything was over. But God had a wonderful, powerful plan!</p>
            <p>Three days after Jesus died, on a Sunday morning, some women who loved Jesus went to His tomb. When they got there, the big stone was rolled away, and the tomb was empty! An angel told them, "Jesus is not here! He has risen, just as He said!" Jesus was alive again! This is called the Resurrection, and it's the most amazing miracle of all. It showed that Jesus truly is God's Son and that He has power over sin and death.</p>
            <p>Jesus appeared to His disciples and many other followers, showing them He was really alive. He ate with them and talked with them. Because Jesus died and rose again, He made a way for everyone who believes in Him to have their sins forgiven and to live forever with God. This is the best news ever, and it's why Easter is such a joyful celebration!</p>
