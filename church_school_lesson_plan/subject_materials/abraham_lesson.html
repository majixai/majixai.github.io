            <h3 class="section-title">Core Bible Story Summary</h3>
            <p>This lesson explores the life of Abraham, known as the father of faith. We will cover God's call to Abraham to leave his home, the covenant promise that he would have countless descendants, and the ultimate test of his faith with his son, Isaac. The key message is about trusting God's promises, even when it's difficult.</p>

            <div class="age-group-container">
                <div class="age-group-box w3-card">
                    <h4>Class 1: Ages 2-5</h4>
                    <p><strong>Focus:</strong> The concepts of "moving" and "stars." Simple trust.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Story Time (2-3 yo):</strong> Focus on the journey. "God told Abraham: 'Go!' and he went!" Use toy people and blocks to build a home, then move them. Show sparkly star stickers. "God promised Abraham a family as big as the stars!"</li>
                        <li><strong>Story Time (4-5 yo):</strong> Tell the story of Abraham and Sarah wanting a baby. Use visuals for the journey and the stars. Briefly mention Isaac as the special promised son.</li>
                        <li><strong>Activity: Starry Night Craft.</strong> Give children black paper and star stickers. Let them fill the paper with "countless" stars. Talk about how God's promise was bigger than Abraham could count.</li>
                        <li><strong>Game: "Father Abraham" Song.</strong> Sing the classic "Father Abraham" song with all the motions (right arm, left arm, etc.). It's repetitive, active, and ties into the theme.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="age-group-box w3-card">
                    <h4>Class 2: Ages 5-8</h4>
                    <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Understanding faith, promises, and difficult choices.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Story Time (5-6 yo):</strong> Read the story from a children's Bible, focusing on the promise of a big family and the birth of Isaac. Discuss how long Abraham and Sarah had to wait, introducing the idea of patience and faith.</li>
                        <li><strong>Story Time (7-8 yo):</strong> Introduce the concept of a covenant. Read the story of the sacrifice of Isaac (Genesis 22), handling it sensitively. Emphasize that God provided a ram and was testing Abraham's trust, not asking him to do something bad. Focus on the theme of trusting God completely.</li>
                        <li><strong>Activity: "Promise Stones."</strong> Have children paint a flat stone. On one side, they can draw a star (God's promise) and on the other, a heart (trust/faith). This serves as a physical reminder of the lesson.</li>
                        <li><strong>Discussion Questions (7-8 yo):</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>What is a promise? Why are promises important?</li>
                                <li>Was it hard for Abraham to leave his home? Why did he do it?</li>
                                <li>What can we learn from Abraham about trusting God, even when we don't understand?</li>
                            </ul>
