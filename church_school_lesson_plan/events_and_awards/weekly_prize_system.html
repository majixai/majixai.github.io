    <div class="w3-panel info-panel w3-padding-16 w3-margin-top w3-card">
        <p>This document provides ideas and considerations for implementing an <span class="important-note w3-large">optional</span> weekly random prize winner system for a 6-7 year old church school class. The primary aim should be to add a little fun and positive anticipation, not to create competition or feelings of exclusion.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-card w3-margin-top w3-padding section-card">
        <h2>Core Philosophy</h2>
        <ul class="w3-ul w3-hoverable">
            <li><strong>Fun & Encouragement:</strong> The system should be light-hearted and seen as a bonus, not a primary motivator for good behavior or learning (these should be intrinsic or encouraged through other means).</li>
            <li><strong>Fairness & Inclusivity:</strong> If implementing, ensure the selection process is genuinely random and that, over time, all children have opportunities.</li>
            <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Keep the system easy to manage for the teacher.</li>
            <li><strong>Optionality:</strong> This is entirely optional. If it doesn't suit your class or teaching style, feel free to disregard it.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-card w3-margin-top w3-padding">
        <h2 class="w3-text-amber">Selection Methods (Random)</h2>
        <ul class="w3-ul">
            <li><strong>Names in a Jar/Hat:</strong>
                <ul class="w3-ul">
                    <li>Write each child's name on a slip of paper.</li>
                    <li>Draw one name at the end of the class on Friday (or your chosen day).</li>
                    <li><span class="important-note">Consider if the drawn name is removed for future draws until all have won, or returned to the jar each week. This impacts frequency options below.</span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Numbered Sticks/Objects:</strong>
                <ul class="w3-ul">
                    <li>Assign each child a number (e.g., based on attendance list).</li>
                    <li>Have numbered popsicle sticks, stones, or tokens. Draw one.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>"Student of the Week" (modified for randomness):</strong>
                <ul class="w3-ul">
                    <li>Instead of basing it on merit, you could randomly select a "Star Helper" or "Special Friend" for the week who also gets a small prize at the end of their "term."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Digital Random Name Picker:</strong>
                <ul class="w3-ul">
                    <li>Many free online tools can randomly pick a name from a list you input. (Ensure you have necessary permissions if using student names online).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                    <h4>Option 1: One Winner Per Week</h4>
                    <p>A single child is chosen each week.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Simple, quick.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Some children may wait a long time for their turn, potentially leading to disappointment if not managed carefully.</p>
                    <p><strong>Management:</strong> If using this, it's often best to remove the winner's name from subsequent draws until everyone has had a turn (if the goal is for everyone to win once per semester/year).</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="w3-half">
                <div class="w3-panel highlight-panel w3-padding">
                    <h4>Option 2: Enough Winners Per Friday for All in a Term/Year</h4>
                    <p>Each Friday (or chosen day), draw enough names so that every child in the class will have been chosen by the end of a set period (e.g., semester or school year).</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> 12 students in class, 12 weeks in a semester. Draw one name per week, removing it from the pool. Everyone wins once.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> 12 students, wish for everyone to win twice a year (24 prize moments). If ~30 teaching weeks, you might draw one name most weeks, and occasionally two if you need to catch up.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Ensures fairness and that everyone gets a turn within a predictable timeframe.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires a bit more tracking by the teacher.</p>
                    <p><strong>Management:</strong> Keep a checklist of students and mark off when they have won to ensure everyone is included.

        <h2 class="w3-text-amber">Prize Ideas (Age-Appropriate & Simple)</h2>
        <p>Prizes should be small, inexpensive, and ideally reinforce positive themes or creativity.</p>
        <ul class="w3-ul">
            <li>Stickers (especially Bible-themed or positive messages)</li>
            <li>Pencils, erasers with fun designs</li>
            <li>A special bookmark</li>
            <li>A small Christian storybook or coloring book (could be from a class library, borrowed for the week)</li>
            <li>A "Choose a Song" pass for next week's class</li>
            <li>"Line Leader" or "Teacher's Helper" for a specific activity next class</li>
            <li>A small craft item (e.g., a few colorful pipe cleaners, a small amount of playdough to take home)</li>
            <li>A certificate: "Congratulations [Child's Name], you're our Shining Star this week!"</li>
            <li><span class="important-note">Avoid food prizes due to allergies and dietary restrictions unless carefully managed.</span></li>
            <li>Consider a "prize box" from which the child can choose one item.</li>
