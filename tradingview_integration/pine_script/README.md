# Scalp POI Strategy — Pine Script v2

**File:** `scalp_poi_hs_dirac.pine`  
**Language:** Pine Script v5  
**Type:** Strategy (backtest-enabled, overlay)

---

## Overview

A multi-engine scalping strategy that detects local price extremes (**Points of
Interest — POI**) from rolling pivot high/low history.  Entry conviction is built
from **15 independent analytical engines** combined into a composite bull/bear
score.  A trade fires only when the score clears a configurable threshold *and*
the bull-minus-bear edge exceeds a minimum gap.

## Engine Components

| # | Engine | Method | Score Contribution |
|---|--------|--------|--------------------|
| ① | **Pivot / POI** | `ta.pivothigh` / `ta.pivotlow` rolling arrays | Break of nearest POI = +1.5 |
| ② | **Head & Shoulders** | 3-pivot geometry + neckline break | +2.0 per confirmed pattern |
| ③ | **Double Top / Bottom** | 2-equal-peak + valley depth check | +1.5 per pattern |
| ④ | **Linear Regression** | Manual OLS: slope, intercept, R², std-error | R² × weight when slope aligned |
| ⑤ | **Polynomial Curvature** | 2nd + 3rd linreg differences (accel + jerk) | ±0.8 / ±0.4 normalised |
| ⑥ | **Dirac Proximity** | Lorentzian `1/(π·w·(1+(x/w)²))` to POI | 0→1 normalised weight |
| ⑦ | **Cosh Momentum** | `cosh(barRet × scale)` magnitude gate | +0.5 when cosh > threshold |
| ⑧ | **Skew Z-Score** | Asymmetric Z with independent bull/bear multipliers | Continuous ±contribution |
| ⑨ | **RSI Divergence** | Higher RSI low / lower RSI high at pivot | +1.2 per divergence |
| ⑩ | **CMF** | Chaikin Money Flow direction | 0→1 × weight |
| ⑪ | **OBV** | On Balance Volume slope | 0→1 × weight |
| ⑫ | **VWAP** | Session VWAP deviation Z-score | 0→2 × weight |
| ⑬ | **Regime** | ADX trending/ranging + MTF EMA | Multiplier 1.0 / 0.5 |
| ⑭ | **Neckline Retest** | Post-break pullback to neckline | +1.2 (H&S weight × 0.6) |
| ⑮ | **Confluence Counter** | Count of agreeing engines (0–9) | Lowers threshold by 0.5 when ≥5 |

## Regression Analysis Detail

The regression subsystem implements **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** from scratch
(Pine Script has no native OLS function that returns statistics):

```
slope     = (n·Σxy − Σx·Σy) / (n·Σx² − (Σx)²)
intercept = (Σy − slope·Σx) / n
R²        = 1 − SS_res / SS_tot
std_err   = √(SS_res / (n − 2))
```

A **regression channel** is plotted at `lrLine ± band_mult × std_err`.

**Polynomial curvature** is approximated via second and third differences of
`ta.linreg` values (no matrix operations needed):

```
accel = (lr[0] − lr[1]) − (lr[1] − lr[2])   // 2nd order
jerk  = accel[0] − accel[1]                  // 3rd order
```

Both are normalised by ATR and contribute independently to the composite score.

## Risk Management

- Fixed SL / TP set at `strategy.exit` on entry.
- **Manual trailing stop** ratchets the protective stop toward the position as
  price moves in the trade's favour.  Updated every bar; never moves against
  the trade.
- **Bar cooldown** prevents re-entering too quickly after a fill.

## Future Recommendations

The following enhancements are planned for subsequent versions:

1. **Volume Profile / VPOC** — accumulate tick-level volume by price bucket to
   identify the Value Area High / Low as additional POI anchors.
2. **Market Structure Shift (MSS) detection** — label each pivot as HH/HL (uptrend)
   or LH/LL (downtrend) and trigger only on confirmed structure breaks.
3. **Wavelet-based noise filter** — apply a Haar or Daubechies wavelet
   decomposition to separate trend from high-frequency noise before computing
   pivot levels.
4. **Kalman Filter price smoothing** — replace raw `close` as input to the OLS
   regression for a lower-noise slope estimate.
5. **Hidden Markov Model regime tagging** — replace the ADX-only regime filter
   with a two-state (trend / range) HMM updated via a Viterbi-like approximation.
6. **Adaptive weight optimisation** — use a rolling Sharpe-ratio gradient to
   periodically re-weight the engine contributions during backtesting.
7. **Multi-symbol basket scoring** — combine scores from correlated instruments
   (e.g. SPY + QQQ) for confluence-filtered entries.
8. **GPT / LLM sentiment overlay** — inject a daily sentiment Z-score fetched
   from the `pine_poi_updater.py` workflow into the composite score via
   `request.seed()`.
9. **Partial profit-taking** — add a mid-TP close (e.g. 50% at 0.8×TP) and let
   remainder run to full TP, reducing average holding time.
10. **Portfolio heat management** — cap the number of simultaneous open positions
    at the strategy level and scale `qty` inversely with current equity drawdown.
